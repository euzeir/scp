This is the project for the exame of Scalable and Cloud Programming for the academic year 2020-2021.
Our objective in this project is to implement well known big data and machine learning algorithms and to show how to deploy them into a cluster of computers (AWS or GC).

In more details we are going to implement the following algorithms:

- Regression::
	1. Linear Regression:
		Purpose: Predicting the price of a house based on a set of features.
		Dataset: "housing.csv" (a dataset of 5000 rows and 6 columns)

- Classification::
	2. Logistic Regression:
		Purpose: Predicting if a client will subscribe (1) or not (0) into a bank.
		Dataset: "banking.csv" (a dataset of 41189 rows and 21 columns)
		[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madmashup/targeted-marketing-predictive-engine/master/banking.csv]

- Clustering::
	K-Means:
		Purpose:
		Dataset:

- Graph Operations:
	Degree of Separation:
		Purpose: Find the degree of separation between a node and all the others in a social network graph dataset (Facebook network)
		Dataset: Facebook dataset of connections.

The project should be developed using Scala as programming language and Apache Spark.


Required:
	- Scala version 2.12.12
	- Spark version 3.0.0
